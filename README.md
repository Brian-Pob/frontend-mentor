# Frontend Mentor

My solutions to various challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
My purpose for this project is to learn more about SolidJS and to practice my CSS skills.
I want to learn more about different tools and technoligies for implementing CSS like TailwindCSS, CSS Modules, and CSS in JS.

If you're looking at the structure of the project, you might notice that I have most of my components organized into their own folders with an `index.tsx` file. This is called a [barrel](https://youtu.be/b0IZo2Aho9Y?t=223). I like to use this pattern because it makes it easier to import components from other files. It also makes the file strucutre look cleaner IMO.
