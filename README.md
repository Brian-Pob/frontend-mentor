# Frontend Mentor

My solutions to various challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies, Prerequisites, and Installation

* Each challenge has its own dependencies. Please refer to the README.md file in each challenge folder.
* Most projects use npm and therefore need npm or an alternative (yarn, pnpm, etc.) to install dependencies.

## Challenges

If it's crossed out it means I've completed it. If it doesn't have a folder it means I haven't started it yet.

## Journal

### 2023-02-24

An attempt to do something cool was made. I tried to make my app an SPA with Solid Router and have each route load a different set of styles. I knew that this would be ideal with a multi page app but I didn't realize it would be so difficult with an SPA. I realized that an app with this structure would not scale well with having to manage so many different style sets. I guess I learned a lot about what not to do `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
