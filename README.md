# Frontend Mentor

My solutions to various challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies, Prerequisites, and Installation

* Each challenge has its own dependencies. Please refer to the README.md file in each challenge folder.
* Most projects use npm and therefore need npm or an alternative (yarn, pnpm, etc.) to install dependencies.

## Authors

* Me - [Github](https://github.com/Brian-Pob) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brianmpdotdev) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/Brian-Pob/)

## Challenges

If it's crossed out it means I've completed it. If it doesn't have a folder it means I haven't started it yet.
