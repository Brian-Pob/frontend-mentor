# Frontend Mentors

My solutions to various challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies, Prerequisites, and Installation

* Each challenge has its own dependencies. Please refer to the README.md file in each challenge folder.
* Most projects use npm and therefore need npm or an alternative (yarn, pnpm, etc.) to install dependencies.
